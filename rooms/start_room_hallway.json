		"red_text": "You travel through the red door to see a truly horrific sight. The room itself is a kitchen with white tile that has since been stained red by huge amounts of blood. Mutilated bodies of people hang from meat hooks on the ceiling, some still dripping with blood. Wooden cabinets and drawers line the walls, and in the center of the room is an island, where a child has been chained on his back. Standing over him is a figure dressed head to toe in a corse white material, though it too has been stained with blood. The outfit seems to be consistent with that of a chef, especially the hat, except the figure wears a black veil to cover its face. The figure holds aloft a meat cleaver, the boy screams, the cleaver comes down on the boy's leg. Cries of agony fill the room as the figure turns to you, apparently just noticing you. It roars and charges you with the cleaver! What do you do?",
		"red_text_A": "You open the door again, only to find the butcher standing directly behind it. The monster cleaves you to your very bones as you feel everything slowly fade to black.",
		"red_peeper_text": "You peek behind the red door to find a truly horrific scene. It's a small kitchen whose white tiles have been painted red with blood. Human bodies hang on meat hooks on the ceiling. In the middle of the kitchen is an island, on which a young boy is screaming for his life. His arms and legs have been individually chained to the sides of the island. A large figure dressed in a corse white material stands over him, hacking his left leg off with a meat cleaver. The figure is wearing a chef's hat made of the same white material, with leather gloves over its hands and a black veil covering its face. It snaps its neck sharply in your direction and then charges, swinging the cleaver violently and screaming incoherently.",

		"dinged_slimy": "The nightstick has green goop running down it, as well as little cuts and dings where the sword hit. While not much can be done about the dings, it may be best to wipe that goop off."
